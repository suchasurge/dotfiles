These are my dotfiles for zsh, vim and other stuff like irbrc, railsrc and gitconfig.

Some of the files and generators are from hashrocket (github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix) and ryanb (github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).
Thx for the awesome stuff.


At this point I try to merge the things that might be usefull for me from the above repos and my configs.

So be carefull when you want to use this, it's still work in progress.


To use MacVim in the terminal, there is an 'vim' alias in the zsh config files.
This only works if you installed MacVim via homebrew


If you are not using homebrew but you want to use your MacVim in the terminal:

sudo ln -s /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim /usr/bin/vim
